The smart destination management requires DMOs and policy-makers to accurately understand and predict visitors’ movements. The aim of this study is to investigate the spillover effects of visitor flows to attractions in London. The originality of the research is the integration of micro, macro and big data into a spatial panel model to tailor-made a demand model for attractions. Social media data is used to develop an asymmetric transition probability matrix which relaxed the symmetric weights in previous spatial models. The findings showed that visitors from neighbouring attractions have significant spillover effect on the selected attraction and the transition probability weighted spatial model improves the model fit, compared with traditional methods. Attractions with strongest spillover effects are identified which can provide empirical evidence for decision-makers to optimise visitors’ footprints and improve public transportation efficiency.
