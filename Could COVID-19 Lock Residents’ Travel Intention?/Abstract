The Covid-19 breakout has not only severely impacted on people’s daily lives and attitudes due to lockdown and social distancing measures but also on travellers as they postpone or cancel their travels to avoid the risks of the pandemic crisis. However, understanding travel intentions is crucial to the recovery of the tourism industry and the whole economy post Covid-19. Using social media data, this study aims to investigate the impact of lockdown on residents’ travel intention in the case of China.
The sentiment score generated by Weibo data in China with the key word “travel” in 1 Jan to 23 Mar 2020 is used to represent the travel intention. In the first phase of the study, the difference-in-difference analysis confirmed that the lockdown causally leads to the decline of travel intention nationally, and particularly the residents from Hubei and provinces with significant visitor inflows from Hubei Province. In the second phase, the network analysis of the textual Weibo data reveals that travel behaviours are associated with the pandemic development and social distancing measures. In the third phase, a spatial Durbin model is used to quantify the impact of Covid-19 confirmed cased on the travel intention across the provinces. The global model shows significant spillover effects of travel intention from neighbouring provinces. Specifically, confirmed cases in a province increased the intention to travel out of the focal province, whereas cases in neighbouring provinces led to a stronger decline in travel intentions. Thus, the net effect of Covid-19 on travel intention is negative. Local models further reveal that the spillover effects of travel intention from neighbouring provinces are stronger in provinces with more confirmed cased. Residents in provinces with less cases were less willing to travel due to higher confirmed cases in other provinces. Practical implications are provided to recover the trust of travellers post Covid-19.
